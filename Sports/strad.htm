<h3 align="left">History</h3>
<p>2004 (Atlanta) - Despite the challenge of playing in a bar with no pitchers, 
and the constant interruption of needing to refill our pints, Tom makes short 
work of Mike at Churchill Arms to take a 1-0 lead.</p>
<p>2005 (Houston) - At The Tavern, surrounded by the loudest, most annoying 
music in the history of strad, Mike evens up the series at 1 game all.</p>
<p>2006 (Houston) - At Pub Fiction, Mike recorded one of the greatest comebacks 
in all of sports, rallying from down 3-1 and down 200+ points in one game, to 
take the series lead 2-1. </p>
<p>2007 (Houston) - At Pub Fiction for the 2nd straight year, Mike dominated, 
playing a good match with just the right amount of luck mixed in for a 4-2 win.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2008 (Atlanta, played in 2009) - At The Independent, after trying 4 other 
bars previously, Mike dominated again in the first ever shutout 4-0.</p>
<p>2009 (Houston, played in 2010) - Mike's wedding weekend at Pub Fiction. Mike 
sweeps 4-0 to earn back to back shutouts.&nbsp; Mike leads the series 5-1.</p>
<p>2010 - (Knoxville) - At Union Jack's, the seemingly only bar in TN with a 
real dart board, Mike rallied down from 3-1 (again) to take a 6-1 lead in the 
series.</p>
<p>2011 - (Houston, played in 2013) - At Dog House Tavern, with their skunky 
beer, after 2 Perfect Margaritas each, Tom dominated 4-1 ending a 6 match losing 
streak.&nbsp; Mike leads the series 6-2.</p>
<p>2012 - in progress, started at Dog House Tavern after the 2011 match, Tom 
leads 1-0.&nbsp; Play was suspended when we were kicked out of the bar at 
closing time.</p>

a player marks with all 3 darts in a turn, his opponent has to plug (1 plug = 
max of 3 sips). 3 doubles in a turn = double plug.&nbsp; Any Round 7 or better = 
finish.&nbsp; If a player 
scores points on all 3 darts while in the lead or in process of taking the lead, 
he must sip along with the opponent's plug.</span></p>

any of his 3 darts in a turn, he takes 1 sip * the number of consecutive turns 
in which he has not marked.&nbsp; For example, missing all three darts the first time 
= 1 sip.&nbsp; Missing all 3 a second consecutive time = 2 sips.&nbsp; This progression 
continues until a) the player marks b) the player finishes (in this case he has 
to finish on each consecutive turn until he marks) c) a timeout is called d) the 
game is forfeited.</span></p>

to each player's score for each One that he has recorded.&nbsp; At this same time, 
five points are subtracted from each player's score for each Off that he has

erases an off if he has offs), marks his 19 (if still open), and marks his other 
dart if it scored.&nbsp; If the other dart is an Off, the player plugs and the turn 
is then over.&nbsp; If it is not an Off and is inside the triples circle, the 
player's opponent sips, and the player re-throws the non one-nine dart.&nbsp; If he 
marks, he scores the mark, the opponent sips, and his turn is over.&nbsp; If he 
doesn't mark, but the dart lands inside the triple circle (non-inclusive), the 
opponent sips and he re-throws the dart as if it were his first re-throw.&nbsp; If he

<h3 align="left">Etiquette <span style="font-weight: 400">(Note: as with any 
drinking game, there is disagreement - of course - with the proper rules of 
etiquette)</span></h3>
<p align="left">1) No talking in your opponent's backswing.</p>
<p align="left">2) Never let your opponent's beer go empty.</p>
<p align="left">3) It is unsportsmanlike to shoot for points when in the lead, 
unless your opponent has scored bulls already.</p>
<p align="left">4) Keep the celebration to a minimum when your opponent is 
struggling.</p>
<p align="left">5) Refrain from calling &quot;buffalo&quot;.&nbsp; In fact, suspend all 
other drinking games (except false ac).</p>
<p align="left">6) Drink for stupidity, wrongness, and especially insisting.</p>
<p align="left">7) Don't buy Bud Light ever.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">8) Rule 7 may be broken if Miller Genuine Headache (MGD) is the 
only other choice.</p>
<p align="left">9) All game interruptions are unacceptable unless said 
interruptions are extremely hot. </p>
